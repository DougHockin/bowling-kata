# Bowling Kata

This is a [code kata](http://codekata.com/), in which you will write a program to score a bowling game. 

We have an initial set of acceptance tests that you can run with `mvn test`

## Requirements
* Java
* Maven
* IDE (Optional)

## Steps
1. Fork this repository
1. Implement `score` and `roll` in `BowlingGame.java` until all the tests pass.
1. Feel free to add tests as needed
1. When you feel your code is complete and clean, create a pull request

Do not edit `bowling.feature` or `CucumberRunnerTest.java`

If you feel more comfortable writing this in another language, feel free. You'll have to write your own tests and make sure you handle all the different types of frames a bowling game can have. 

Use `bowling.feature` to get a feeling for the rules and how the game is scored.
