Bowling Kata

You can run the tests with `mvn test`

Create a branch first.

Implement `score` and `roll` in the `BowlingGame` until all the tests pass.

Do not edit `bowling.feature` or `CucumberRunnerTest.java`

When finished, create a [pull request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) and submit it.
